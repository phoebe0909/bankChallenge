# bankChallenge
This project was created for Learn Programming Academy’s Masterclass in Java. The challenge was to create a simulation of a bank that allowed the user to create new branches, create customers for those branches, and make simple deposits and withdrawals from the customers’ accounts.

The primary focus of the exercise was learning to work with ArrayLists, creating classes, and understanding private access modifiers within classes.
